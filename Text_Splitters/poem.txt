Whispers of the Quiet Sky

Beneath a sky of twilight blue,  
The stars emerge, a silver hue.  
The moonlight dances on the streams,  
Awakening long-forgotten dreams.  

The trees converse in rustling sighs,  
Their leaves like voices in disguise.  
A gentle breeze begins to roam,  
And every shadow finds a home.  

The flowers close in silent prayer,  
Night cradles all with tender care.  
The world, now hushed, begins to sleep,  
Its secrets buried soft and deep.  

In stillness, peace begins to grow,  
A rhythm only night can know.  
And in that calm, the soul takes flight,  
To wander freely with the night.
